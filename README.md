# DevOps Toolkit Portfolio

> **ℹ️ What is Vagrant and Why Use It in DevOps?**
>
> Vagrant is a powerful tool for building and managing virtualized development environments. In a DevOps culture, Vagrant enables teams to easily replicate development and testing environments, ensuring consistency across local machines and production systems. This reduces "works on my machine" issues, enhances collaboration, and improves security by isolating environments and automating provisioning. By using Vagrant, DevOps teams can streamline workflows, enforce best practices, and maintain reliable, reproducible infrastructure.
